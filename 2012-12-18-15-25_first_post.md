There are times you want to reach your development server at work but it
doesn't have a public IP address. However you can reach and have access to the
network gateway. You can easily access your server in two steps, first ssh to
the gateway and then to your destination. But isn't that a bit time consuming?
What will you do if you want to send a bunch of files over? Funny thing is
that ssh devs have already taken care of that.

There is an option in ssh which allows you to execute a proxy command. Now
if this command is set to be a combination of ssh to the gateway and netcat
your traffic to your server voila you have reached your server with one
command, virtually in one step.

So lets try a hands on example. I want to access a machine address
192.168.1.230 (thats the local IP of my server, for simplicity lets ignore any local
domain names). I have access to foo.bar.org which is the domain name of the gateway.
Here is a snippet of ~/.ssh/config from my machine:

<pre>
<code>Host devserv
  User user
  Hostname 192.168.1.230
  ProxyCommand ssh -a user@foo.bar.org netcat %h %p
</code></pre>

And that's it. This line will execute before I can connect to devserv and
allow me to access it.
